# Unity3D-Box-Shooter-Game

Box Shooter is a simple 3D shooting game, with boxes having special power to kill the players time. 

Special effort was made to create a user friendly game complete with game UI and in game UI and 3D animation. 

This is a time sensative game the player can move in a degistaned area and shoot the right boxes to increase time and don't loose to the time

Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!
